Here's how Exploding Zombie Chase works:

You wake up in a sketchy warehouse somewhere, and just need to make 
your way to the escape hatch at the opposite corner.
There's just one problem...

Zombies!!

Between you and the hatch are multiple zombies that can sense your every 
move, and move closer to you every second.

Your disadvantage: You can only move up horizontally or vertically, and 
zombies can move diagonally.

Your advantage: You know exactly what the zombies will do. And this is how:
- Zombies will ALWAYS try to move one move diagonally in your direction 
  (they can squeeze between blocks if the diagonal spot is open), unless you 
  are exactly in line with them vertically or horizontally, in that case they
  will move one space in your direction
- That means that if a barrier stands between the zombie's path to you, it 
  will stand there and wait until the path to you no longer is on the other 
  side of a barrier
- Also, these are exploding zombies! If two zombies collide on their way to 
  you, they explode!

See if you can survive the zombies, and get them to explode so they open up a path to safety!
Basic controls are:
w - up
a - left
d - right
s - down
q - quit.
